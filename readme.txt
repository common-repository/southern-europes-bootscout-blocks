== Description ==
Southern Europe's BootScout Blocks is a plugin that adds block patterns to support Scout Leaders in creating a wordpress website.
The Pattern Blocks are designed to work primarily with the BootScout Wordpress theme, but they also work with the #Skillforlife Wordpress theme. They most likely will not work with any other theme.
Our plugin requires ‘Stackable - Gutenberg Blocks’ & ‘Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks – Page Builder Features’ however don’t worry about finding this as our plugin will automatically install them for you.
For those who want to use the plugin and need some assistance setting up the pattern blocks check out the documentation: [Southern Europe's BootScout Pattern Block Guide] (https://thomasthorne.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Southern-Europes-BootScout-Pattern-Blocks.pdf)

This plugin was created by Thomas Thorne an adult volunteer who created these to support the adult volunteers within Southern Europe District.
